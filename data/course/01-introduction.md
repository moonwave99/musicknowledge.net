If you are reading this chances are that you play an instrument at some level or you are just genuinely curious about music. In either case congratulations, you landed on the right place!

This course aims at giving you the tools to **read and write music**, to understand some **musical common structures**, and to **train your ear** to recognize the building blocks of music.

## Covered topics

This course assumes no prior knowledge. The main areas that we will see together are:

- the **building blocks of music**: notes, intervals, arpeggios, scales...
- how music works over time, **tempo** and **rhythm**;
- the basics of **standard music notation**;
- the foundations of **tonal harmony**;
- an excursus over another approach: **modality**.

## What you need

If piano is not your instrument of choice, a **digital keyboard** of sort would be of great help since the provided instrument diagrams are piano based, and music theory is much easy to apply and follow on such instrument. [Music staff paper][music-staff-paper] would be handy too, even though not strictly necessary.

## Some little advice before starting

Music is one of the most beautiful things that one can experience in life. It's beauty, freedom, love, care, shelter. Some people think that studying it takes some of the aforementioned away: nothing can be further from the truth! Learning it will make you a better musician especially in group context and will empower you.

I have encountered many students trying to make sense of every single bit of information, only to eventually realize that music is not meant to be an absolutely coherent yet sterile set of rules, but rather a breathing entity that is evolving since the beginning of human history. It developed itself independently all over the planet, and different locales called the same thing in different ways.

Generations of musicians handed down conventions and knowledge with success over the centuries, dealing with reasonable limitations and contradictions. People went from playing for monarchs to freely express themselves: purposes changed, taste evolved.

Embrace diversity like when you discover a new language, culture or cuisine: it will make the journey much more pleasant.
