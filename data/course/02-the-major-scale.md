_Writing about music is like dancing about architecture_, somebody said.  
That's why we'll start by listening to a nice melody at least:

```abc
X:1
T:You Are My Sunshine
C:Traditional
M:4/4
L:1/4
K:C
z G, C D|E2 E2-| E E D E| C2 C2-|
w:You are my sun-shine,_ my on-ly sun-shine.
C C D E|F2 A2-| A A G F|E4-|
w:_You make me hap-py_ when skies are gray,
E C D E|F2 A2-| A A G F|E2 C2-|
w:_You'll ne-ver know, dear,_ how much I love you,
C z C D| E3 F| D D2 E|C4|
w:_Please don't take my sun-shine a-way.
```

Treat yourself [to this beautiful version][johnny-cash] if you haven't yet.

If this is the first time you are looking at music notation, consider yourself lucky: you can see which notes are being played in real time!

Listen to it again. See how:

- when the melody "goes up", the notes on the staff are placed higher as well;
- longer notes have white (or better empty) head symbols.

Before defining what it means for a melody to go up or down, we can affirm that music notation communicates **the height** and **the duration** of sounds.

## The white keys of the piano

Listen to the melody again and pay attention to the little piano below the score. Has any black key been played? No, and not by coincidence!

Listen to the following now:

```abc
X:2
M:1/1
L:1
CDEFGABc
```

Just the white keys again, more precisely we listened to:

- eight **consecutive** notes;
- starting from the white key located right **before the group of two black keys**.

The full sequence before is called **the C major scale**.

<div class="text-note">

ℹ️ **Note**: we are about to introduce many concepts that can be new to you: note names, scales, intervals. You are not required to get everything right on the first attempt.

Absorb what you can but most important: listen, play, have fun and come back again to the text after you have more practice!

## The piano layout

Every note on the piano sounds different from each other, otherwise they wouldn't have put them there! But if we look at the keyboard without playing it, we'll notice a repeating pattern of:

- **three white keys** enclosing **two black keys**;
- **four white keys** enclosing **three black keys**.

Graphically we have:

```piano
one: C3 D3 E3 C4 D4 E4 C5 D5 E5
two: F3 G3 A3 B3 F4 G4 A4 B4 F5 G5 A5 B5
```

This is a very convenient way to navigate the keyboard, both visually and tactfully.

Listen to the following two sequences:

```abc
X:4
M:1/1
L:1
CDEFGABc | z | cdefgabc'
```

They are not technically the same notes because they are played in different locations, but they sound _extremely similar_. That's because we are playing the same thing - the C major scale - **in different octaves**. Different keys, but same pattern.

This is one of the pillars of music.

## Naming things

There is nothing inherently special about the C major scale, besides the fact that's very easy to spot and play on a keyboard. We need a starting point to build our knowledge and this is very convenient.

We know how the first note of the scale is called, but what about the others?

```abc hideplayer hidepiano
X:5
M:1/1
L:1
CDEFGABc
w: C D E F G A B C
```

It's observation time:

- they are labeled **in alphabetical order**...
- ...but after the fifth one - the **G** - it comes the **A** (and not the H!)

This is because the major scale is made of **seven notes**.
